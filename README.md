## Project Introduction

A third-party nurse staffing agency’s sales leadership team has asked for recommendations on possible business decisions based on the Q1 2024 Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ) Daily Nurse Staffing dataset. In this analysis, I will analyze the Q1 2024 Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ) Daily Nurse Staffing dataset and the State US Averages dataset to provide possible areas for staffing growth.

## Analysis Outline

Within this analysis, in the first half, I will uncover new insights and unusual anomalies within the dataset to see if there are any growth opportunities or new demographics to target. The key questions we are looking for are:

• Which state has the largest daily hospital resident population?

• Which counties have the most healthcare facilities?

• What is the total number of contract hours worked compared to employee hours?

• Which nursing positions are the most in-demand?

• Which states have the most potential for contractor staffing growth?


## Conclusion

### Key Findings

• California, New York, Texas, Florida, and Pennsylvania are the largest states in terms of total daily residents

• Los Angeles County, Cook County, Montgomery County, Jefferson County, and Washington County are the counties with the highest number of medical facilities

• Contract hours worked is about 3% of the total hours worked and has much room to grow

• LPN and CNA workers are the most in-demand based on hours worked this quarter

• States/Territories that require more nurses based on average hours spent on residents are Alaska, Puerto Rico, Oregon, DC, and Hawaii
